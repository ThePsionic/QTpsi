# QTΨ
QTΨ (often named QTpsi because Greek) is a Discord bot filled with memes.

It should be noted that this bot is for an old version of Discord.js and **does not work in its current state**. 
I also have no interest in maintaining this anymore, but if you want to continue development yourself, fork this repo and be my guest.

## Requirements
This bot needs NodeJS installed. Install all requirements by going to the bot folder and using `npm install`. This installs
all required modules (which really is just Discord.JS).
